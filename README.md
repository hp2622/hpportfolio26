# **React Portfolio**
This is a React Portfolio that uses a combination of React, Bootstrap, and Github Pages. I built the entirety of the portfolio from scratch using React's functional components, [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for styling, and [Vectr](https://vectr.com/) for all of my graphic design needs.

This portfolio contains some of my recent projects that display my aptitude for rapidly developing full stack applications. In the portfolio section there is a wide range of types of projects: frontend, backend, full stack, etc. I plan on continuing to hone my React skills as I dive deeper into the fullstack development world.
